This repository contains two java applications for displaying images.

The SlideShow app shows a large central image flanked by thumbnails on
the left and right that represent the images before and after it in
the image sequence.  Scroll through the images by clicking on the
image you want to put in the center, or use the spacebar/backspace, or
left/right arrows, or PgUp/PgDn keys.

The PictureScroller app displays images as a smoothly scrolling strip
of images.  Use the spacebar to pause/unpause the scrolling.  'h' key
activates horizontal scrolling.  'v' key activates vertical scrolling.
